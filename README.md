# DNS MITM Manager
![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/JP3402/DNS-MITM-Manager)

A simple homebrew application for the Nintendo Switch to manage DNS MITM hosts files used by Atmosphere.

## Features

-   Dynamically detects and lists available hosts files (`default.txt`, `emummc.txt`, `sysmmc.txt`).
-   Provides a simple UI to enable or disable individual entries in the selected hosts file.
-   Saves changes back to the selected hosts file.

## Installation

1.  Download the latest `dns-mitm-manager.nro` from the [releases page](https://github.com/JP3402/dns-mitm-manager/releases).
2.  Copy `dns-mitm-manager.nro` to the `/switch/` folder on your SD card.
3.  Launch the application from the Homebrew Menu.

## Usage

1.  On startup, the application will scan your `/atmosphere/hosts/` directory for `default.txt`, `emummc.txt`, and `sysmmc.txt`.
2.  A menu will appear showing the hosts files that were found.
3.  Use the **D-Pad Up/Down** to navigate the list of files and press **A** to select one.
4.  In the main editor screen, use the **D-Pad Up/Down** to select a host entry.
5.  Press **A** to toggle the selected entry on or off. An `[X]` indicates the entry is active, while `[ ]` indicates it is commented out and inactive.
6.  Press **Y** to save your changes back to the file. A "Saved!" message will appear.
7.  Press **+** to exit the application at any time.
