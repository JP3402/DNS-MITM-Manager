# DNS-MITM-Manager
DNS-MITM-manager is a Nintendo Switch homebrew tool for managing Atmosphere’s DNS redirection. It provides a GUI to easily toggle host files and entries (default.txt/emummc.txt) directly on your console. This allows you to block Nintendo’s servers—preventing telemetry and accidental updates—without needing a PC or manual file editing.
